### Getting started:

1. Before running the notebook, please make sure to have the following python version and libraries are installed <br>
- python 3.9.12
- pytorch (https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/)

2. Create an account in Weights and Biases (WANDB) (https://wandb.ai/home). While running the notebook, you maybe prompted to enter the WANDB username

### Files

1. **TimeSeriesModeling.ipynb** - The primary notebook to be run
2. **encoder_decoder.py** - This script contain the model architecture code and related functions
3. **utils.py** - Script containing helper functions, like, read and write files, plot, etc.
